# VSCode Extension Starter

## Description

This is a starter template for creating a new VSCode extension. It includes a basic setup for a Webview-based extension.

It uses the following technologies:

- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwindcss
- Webpack

## Pre-requisites

```sh
npm install
```

## Development

1. Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette, then run `Hello World`.
3. Make changes to a file. Webpack will automatically rebuild the code, but it won't hot reload the webview.
4. Reload (`Ctrl+R`) within the extension window to see your changes.
